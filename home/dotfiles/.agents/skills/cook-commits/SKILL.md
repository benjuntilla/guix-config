description: create git commits based on unstaged changes
---

look at all of the staged and unstaged changes in our git worktree and figure out a good
way to split up the changes into focused commits with clear, concise
messages. strike a good balance between many smaller, atomic commits
VS less, but bigger commits.

then, actually make those commits and push them up to origin
